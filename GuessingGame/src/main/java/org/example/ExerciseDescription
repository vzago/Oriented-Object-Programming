Game Overview:

Implement a simple number guessing game where one player
(the computer) selects a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the other player
(the user) tries to guess it based on feedback.

Class Definition:

Define a class named GuessingGame.
Its variables have to represent the game status.
Which variables are you going to use?
What are their type?
This class should contain methods to.
set up the game: game.setup(...)
accept user guesses: game.acceptGuess(...)
provide feedback (higher, lower, or correct guess): game.feedback(...)
count the number of guesses: game.countGuess(...)
What parameters should these methods receive, if any.
What values they should return, if any.
The main method is the only thing that can be static.
Main Method:

In your GuessingGame class, include a main method that instantiates a GuessingGame object and starts the game.
The game should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

User Input:
Use the java.util.Scanner class to read the user's guesses from the console.
Feedback Mechanism:

After each guess, the program should provide feedback to the user if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Ending the Game:

Once the user guesses the number correctly,
display a congratulatory message including the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.
